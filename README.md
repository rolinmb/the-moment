Qudit in C on Windows (no complex numbers for state probability amplitudes just yet...)

Build and run from root: gcc -o src/main src/main.c src/true_rand.c src/complex.c src/qudit.c -lcrypt32 -lm

TODO:
    - sigh i should learn how to implement complex numbers as a type/struct from scratch in C (that shouldn't be too hard...?)
